# BusEase: Intelligent Route & Seat Reservation System

BusEase is a modern web-based platform designed to simplify and digitize the process of highway bus booking. It allows users to search for available routes, check real-time seat availability, book tickets, and make secure online payments. The system also provides an admin panel for bus operators to manage routes, buses, schedules, and bookings.

 ### User Side

- Route search by source, destination, and travel date
- **Multileg route search** (suggests shortest combinations of buses if no direct route is found)
- Real-time seat availability
- Interactive seat layout with selection
- Secure online payment integration (Stripe)
- Booking confirmation via email (ticket)
- Booking history dashboard


 ### Admin Side
- Admin login with role-based access
- Add/edit/delete routes, buses, and schedules
- Configure seat layouts per bus
- View passenger lists per trip
- Booking analytics dashboard

 ### Tech Stack

 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yasas2000/BusBookingApp.git
cd BusBookingApp

1. Frontend Setup
cd Frontend
npm install

Create a .env file in /Frontend with the following variables:

for front end env

VITE_APP_API_PROTOCOL=http
VITE_APP_API_HOST=localhost
VITE_APP_API_PORT=4000

Then run: npm start

2. Backend Setup
cd ../Backend
npm install

Create a .env file in /Backend with the following variables:

for back end env

MONGO_URI = 
JWT_SECRET = 
REFRESH_SECRET = 
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
SUCCESS_URL = http://localhost:5000/payment/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
CANCEL_URL = http://localhost:5000/cart
TICKET_IMAGE = https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/bus-ticketpublic-transport-side-view-600nw-2418862123.jpg

#keys and secrets you have to use tour own ones

â€¢Use this for testing:
Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry Date: any future date
CVC: any 3 digits
ZIP: any 5 digits

â€¢	After successful payment, users receive their ticket by email.

Security & Validation
â€¢	JWT-based authentication and route protection
â€¢	Password hashing with bcrypt
â€¢	Role-based access (user/admin)
â€¢	Stripe for secure, PCI-compliant payments

 Testing
â€¢	Postman used for API testing
â€¢	Manual tests for seat-locking and booking flow
â€¢	Live testing with multiple browser sessions for real-time logic

 Future Enhancements
â€¢	GPS tracking of buses
â€¢	SMS  notifications
â€¢	Multilingual UI
